                    <h2>1955-2011</h2> 
                    <h3>Founder of apple</h3>
                    <div class="discription">
                            Steven Paul Jobs ( February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate, industrial designer, 
                            investor, and media proprietor. He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), and co-founder of Apple Inc.;
                             the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar;
                             a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder,
                             chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s 
                            and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.
                           <br> 
                            Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, and put up for adoption. He was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
                            He attended Reed College in 1972 before dropping out that same year, and traveled through India in 1974 seeking
                             enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism.
                            <br><br>
                            Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. 
                            Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced 
                            microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical
                             user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough 
                            Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing 
                            industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics.

                    <h3>The following list is the timeline of Steve Jobs</h3>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li><strong>1955</strong> - Steven Paul Jobs is born in San Francisco to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali. The then-unmarried couple give up their son to adoption. Paul and Clara Jobs become Jobs' non-biological parents.    </li>
                        <li><strong>1961</strong> - The Jobs family moves to Mountain View, Calif., part of what would later become known as Silicon Valley.</li>

                        <li><strong>1970</strong> - Meets future Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak through a friend. In Wozniak's 2006 autobiography, "iWoz," he notes that the two "hit it off" immediately, despite their four-year age difference.                        </li>
                        <li><strong>1972</strong> - Graduates from Homestead High School in Cupertino, Calif., and enrolls at Reed College in Portland, Ore., only to drop out a semester later. Jobs would go on to sit in on classes that interested him, such as calligraphy, despite not getting credit for them.                        </li>
                        <li><strong>1974</strong> - Begins a brief stint as an engineer at Atari. Working the night shift, he employs Wozniak to help whittle down the hardware required for a prototype of a single-player version of Pong, the game that would go on to become Breakout. Jobs leaves Atari in the summer to travel through India, only to return to California to live in a commune.
                                                     Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO John Sculley.
                                                     That same year, Jobs took a few of Apple's members with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company
                                                     that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he helped to develop 
                                                    the visual effects industry when he funded the computer graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986.
                                                     The new company was Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer animated feature film Toy Story (1995), 
                                                     and went on to become a major animation studio, producing over 20 films since then.
                           
                                                    Jobs became CEO of Apple in 1997, following his company's acquisition of NeXT. 
                                                     He was largely responsible for helping revive Apple, which had been on the verge of bankruptcy. 
                                                    He worked closely with designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning in 1997 with the "Think different" advertising campaign and leading to the iMac, iTunes, iTunes Store, Apple Store, iPod, iPhone, App Store, and the iPad. In 2001, the original Mac OS was replaced with the completely new Mac OS X (now known as macOS), based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the OS a modern Unix-based foundation for the first time. Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in 2003. He died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor at age 56 on October</li>
                        <li><strong>1976</strong> - Co-founds Apple Computer with Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. That same year, the company sells the Apple I in the form of a kit that sells for $666.66.                        </li>
                        <li><strong>1977</strong> - Apple incorporates. <br><br> Releases the Apple II, the first commercially available personal computer in a plastic case with color graphics--and Apple's first successful personal computer.                                         </li>
                        <li><strong>1980</strong> - Apple goes public, putting Jobs' net worth north of $200 million.                        </li>
                        <li><strong>1984</strong> - Two days after the $1.5 million Ridley Scott-directed "1984" Super Bowl commercial airs, introduces the Macintosh to much fanfare during Apple's shareholder meeting. "For the first time ever, I'd like to let Macintosh speak for itself." The computer's voice then says, "Never trust a computer you can't lift." Macintosh becomes the first commercially successful small computer with a graphical user interface.                        </li>
                        <li><strong>1985</strong> - CEO John Sculley engineers Jobs' ouster from Apple. Jobs resigns as Apple chairman, saying in a board meeting, "I've been thinking a lot, and it's time for me to get on with my life. It's obvious that I've got to do something. I'm 30 years old." Soon thereafter, Jobs starts NeXT Computer (which later becomes NeXT Software), funded by selling $70 million of his Apple stock. An "interpersonal" NeXT workstation, sporting a built-in Ethernet port, is used by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN to become the first server of the World Wide Web.                        </li>
                        <li><strong>1986</strong> - For $10 million, buys the Graphics Group division of Lucasfilm that becomes Pixar Animation Studio.  </li>
                        <li><strong>1988</strong> - NeXT Computer releases its first computer.</li>
                        <li><strong>1993</strong> - NeXT discontinues hardware business, gets into software instead. The company is renamed NeXT Software, Inc.</li>
                        <li><strong>1995</strong> - Becomes Pixar's president and CEO. Later in the year, Jobs brings Pixar public, one week after the release of "Toy Story," with Tom Hanks doing the voice of Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear. The film earns $192 million at the box office. Its success helps make it quite attractive for celebrities to lend their voices to animated characters.                        </li>
                        <li><strong>1996</strong> - Returns to Apple, as an adviser, after it buys NeXT for $429 million.                        </li>

                        <li><strong>2000</strong> - Drops the "interim" from his CEO title at the Macworld Expo, joking that he would be using the title "iCEO," paying homage to the company's product-naming conventions. Takes a $1 annual salary. Soon terminates projects including Newton and OpenDoc, and changes licensing terms to make Mac-cloning cost-prohibitive. Technologies developed at NeXT ultimately evolve into Apple products such as the Mac OS.                        </li>
                        <li><strong>2001</strong> - Introduces iTunes, then exclusively for Mac users. "iTunes is miles ahead of every other jukebox application, and we hope its dramatically simpler user interface will bring even more people into the digital music revolution."                        </li>
                        <li><strong>2002</strong> - Apple introduces the first Windows-compatible iPods at Macworld.  </li>
                        <li><strong>2003</strong> - Opens the iTunes Music Store in the United States. Apple sold 10 billion songs via iTunes as of February 24, 2010, and it counted 225 million iTunes accounts with credit cards as of June 2011.                        </li>

                        <li><strong>2005</strong> - Apple introduces an iPod Shuffle. "iPod Shuffle is smaller and lighter than a pack of gum and costs less than $100...With most flash memory music players, users must use tiny displays and complicated controls to find their music; with iPod Shuffle you just relax, and it serves up new combinations of your music every time you listen."                        </li>
                        <li><strong>2006</strong> - Disney buys Pixar for $7.4 billion; Jobs joins Disney's board as its top shareholder. As of March 2011, Jobs owns 138 million shares of Disney, an estimated 7.29 percent of the company, and his net worth is estimated to be $8.3 billion. He owns 5.426 million shares of Apple as of February 2011.                        </li>
